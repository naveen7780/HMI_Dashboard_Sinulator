# HMI Dashboard Simulator

This project simulates the behavior of various Human-Machine Interface (HMI) controls using C++ algorithms and object-oriented design patterns. It covers tasks like data manipulation using STL containers, implementing observer patterns, and handling dynamic control updates based on system mode.

## Tasks Overview

1. **Task 1**: Demonstrates basic usage of STL containers (vectors) to store control states, and displays them.
2. **Task 2**: Uses sets and vectors to demonstrate dynamic and static widget management, including searching, merging, and displaying widgets.
3. **Task 3**: Shows how to manipulate control states by filling, generating, and transforming control objects with STL algorithms.
4. **Task 4**: Implements merging of two sorted lists of controls using a custom comparison function and the `merge` algorithm from the STL.
5. **Task 5**: Implements the Observer design pattern to update control visibility based on the mode of the HMI system (e.g., Night Mode).

## Files

- `main.cpp`: The entry point of the program that calls the tasks in sequence.
- `Task1.cpp`: Contains the implementation for Task 1 (control state display).
- `Task2.cpp`: Contains the implementation for Task 2 (widget management).
- `Task3.cpp`: Contains the implementation for Task 3 (control state manipulation).
- `Task4.cpp`: Contains the implementation for Task 4 (merging sorted controls).
- `Task5.cpp`: Contains the implementation for Task 5 (Observer design pattern for mode updates).
- `Task1.h`, `Task2.h`, `Task3.h`, `Task4.h`, `Task5.h`: Header files that define the task function signatures and necessary includes.

## Requirements

- **C++11 or later** for full compatibility with STL algorithms and smart pointers.
- A C++ compiler that supports modern C++ standards (GCC, Clang, or MSVC recommended).

## How to Build and Run

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/naveen7780/HMI_Dashboard_Sinulator.git
cd HMI_Dashboard_Sinulator


Example Output
Hereâ€™s an example output when running the program:

              Running Task 1...
              ID: 1, Type: button, State: visible
              ID: 2, Type: button, State: invisible
              ID: 3, Type: slider, State: disabled
              ID: 4, Type: button, State: visible
              ID: 5, Type: slider, State: invisible
              ...
              
              Running Task 2...
              Dynamic widget: Speedometer
              Dynamic widget: Tachometer
              ...
              
              Running Task 3...
              All controls set to disabled.
              ...
              
              Running Task 4...
              ID: 1, Type: button, State: invisible
              ID: 2, Type: button, State: visible
              ...
              
              Running Task 5...
              Button visibility adjusted for Night mode.
              Slider visibility adjusted for Night mode.
              



Design Patterns
This project also demonstrates the following design patterns:

Observer Pattern (Task 5): Used to manage the visibility of controls based on mode changes (like switching to Night mode).
